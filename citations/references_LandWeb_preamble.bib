	title = {Development of historical forest attribute layers using {Landsat} time series and {kNN} imputation for the western {Canadian} boreal forest},
	abstract = {The purpose of this report is to describe the creation of spatially continuous layers of forest attributes for the LandWeb study area. A primary objective of the LandWeb project is the prediction of forest attributes (height, canopy cover, and species) for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and a dateless layer. These layers are designed to assist modelers in back-casting the LandWeb
study area to the pre-industrial landscape condition.
In this technical note, we describe the methods for  predicting the target forest attributes across the LandWeb study area using a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) approach. We utilized the Common Attribute Schema for Forest Resource Inventories (CASFRI) dataset for training a kNN model and acquired several ancillary datasets to impute the target forest attributes for locations of the LandWeb study area where CASFRI data were not available. We cross-validated the predicted attributes with a reserved set of the observed CASFRI records to derive estimates of accuracy. Accuracy statements for the layers are provided to support and we discuss the possible uses for the predictions.},
